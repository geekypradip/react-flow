# React Flow Chart

This project is a flow chart creator built with React Flow. It uses React with TypeScript for the main application logic, Material UI (MUI) for the user interface, and Notistack for notifications and alerts.

## Features

- Create and update nodes
- Drag and drop text boxes to create nodes
- Save the current flow to localStorage
- Validate for empty node entries and ensure all nodes are connected before saving

## Known Issues

- After dropping a text box into the canvas, the node position may not be accurate. If you can't see the node after dragging and dropping, zoom out the viewport and you should find it.

2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
